<div align="center"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/iw-android-view-activity-log-of-a-vc-1.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/iw-android-view-activity-log-of-a-vc-3.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/iw-android-view-activity-log-of-a-vc-3.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

== Credential Sharing Methods

== Pre-requisites

* Two or more devices with Inji Wallet installed are required to share credentials. The relying party's phone should be an Android device.
* All required permissions like Bluetooth, location, and camera access are enabled on both devices.
* The parties involved are usually a Resident (sharing party) who wishes to share their credentials with a Relying party (receiving party), a banker, a health worker, or other professional service.

Users can now share their credentials using any of the methods listed below:

. Share option from the NavBar.
. Share or Share with Selfie option from the quick access menu (...) from a VC in the _Home Page_
. Share or Share with Selfie option from quick access menu (...) in _detailed view_ of VC.

Let us understand the process of sharing credentials using an example and see the step-wise process for all the above three methods. Suppose a Resident wishes to share their credentials with a Relying/ Requesting party through the receiver's phone, the following steps outline the procedure for both parties involved:

=== _Share_ _from Share Option in NavBar_

_On the Sharing Party's phone:_

* The resident opens the QR Code Scanner by clicking on the `Share` button in the NavBar. The application now prompts for permissions.
* Upon granting the necessary permissions, the app opens a camera where the resident can scan the QR code of the recipient's (Verifier/Relying Party) phone.
* Once the QR code is successfully scanned, both phones will establish a Bluetooth connection.
* The resident then needs to choose a downloaded VC and select either the Share or the Share with Selfie option.
* The Share button will solely share the VC, while the Share with Selfie option will verify if the sender's face matches the photo in the VC before proceeding to share.

_On the Relying Party's phone_

* This functionality is only available on Android devices. To access it, the receiver needs to navigate to the settings page and locate the `Receive Cards` option.
* On selecting this option, it will open the QR code page. For the relying party to be able to receive a card, the resident needs to scan the QR code using a shared phone. Once the QR code is scanned and shared, the relying party will receive the VC and be able to preview its contents.
* To view the received cards, they would need to access the settings page and find the `Received Cards` section. Clicking on this section will display the received cards. If the receiver has not received any card, this section will be empty.
* Please note that the relying party can only view the received cards and will not be able to share or perform other actions with them.

=== _Share / Share with Selfie from Home Page Quick Access menu_

_On the Sharing Party's phone:_

* The resident clicks on the quick access menu (...) from a VC on the Home Page and chooses the Share or Share with Selfie option from the menu.
* The application now prompts for permissions if not granted already.
* Upon granting the necessary permissions, the app opens a camera where the resident can scan the QR code of the recipient's (Verifier/Relying Party) phone.
* Once the QR code is successfully scanned, both phones will establish a Bluetooth connection.
* The Share button will solely share the VC, while the Share with Selfie option will verify if the sender's face matches the photo in the VC before proceeding to share.

=== _Verifiable Credential Sharing & Presentation via OpenID4VP_

____
_Note:_ Screenshots will be added soon to enhance the user experience and better explain the steps shown below.
____

==== Cross-Device Flow (OpenID4VP)

This method is used when you're using _Inji Wallet on a mobile phone_ and the verifier (e.g., a service provider or kiosk) is using a _separate device_ such as a laptop, tablet, or scanner.

_Steps to Present Credentials:_

. _Verifier generates a QR code_ on their system/portal requesting specific credentials.
. On your _Inji Wallet_, tap the _QR scanner icon_ from the home screen or use the “Share” option.
. _Scan the QR code_ displayed by the verifier.
. The wallet reads the verifier’s request and shows you a list of _matching credentials_.
. You are prompted for _face authentication_.
. Choose the credentials you want to share.
. Tap _“Share”_ to proceed. The wallet sends the Verifiable Presentation (VP) to the verifier securely.
. You’ll see a confirmation message once the sharing is complete.

==== Same-Device Flow (OpenID4VP)

This method is useful when you’re _accessing a portal from the same mobile device_ that has the Inji Wallet installed.

_Steps to Present Credentials:_

. On your phone browser, visit the service portal that is requesting your credentials.
. Tap on the _“QR Code”_ or similar button.
. This opens a _deep link_ that launches your _Inji Wallet app_ automatically.
. The wallet fetches the verifier’s request.
. A list of matching credentials is displayed.
. You will be asked for _face authentication_.
. Choose the credentials to be shared.
. Tap _“Share”_.
. You are automatically redirected back to the service portal (Android).
   _ On _iOS*, you may need to manually switch back to the browser.

=== Pinning a VC

After clicking on the ellipsis button on the downloaded VC, a button will appear allowing for the VC to be pinned. Selecting this option will pin the specific VC to the top of the screen.
