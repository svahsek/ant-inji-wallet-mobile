= VCI-Client

== VCI-Client

vci-client library enables to carry out the credential request from the consumer application (mobile wallet or web) and download the VC.

== Features:

* Creates a credential request with access token, issuer metadata, holder jwt proof.
* Provide credential response (VC) to the consumer application.
* Kotlin and Swift artefacts are available to integrate with the native mobile applications.

Below sections details on the steps for integrating the Kotlin and Swift packages into the app.
