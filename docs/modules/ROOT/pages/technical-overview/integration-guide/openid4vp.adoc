= OpenID4VP

== OpenID4VP - Online Sharing

This library enables consumer applications (mobile wallet) to share users Verifiable Credentials with Verifiers who request them online. It adheres to the OpenID4VP [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-23.html) draft version 23, which outlines the standards for requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials.

==== Library Functionalities: Processing the Request from Decoding to Verifier Response

. Receives the Verifier's Authorization Request sent by the consumer application (mobile wallet).
. Validates the received Authorization Request to check if the required details are present or not, and then returns the Authorization Request to the consumer application once all the validations are successful.
. Receives the list of Verifiable Credentials from the consumer application which are selected by the consumer application end-user based on the credentials requested as part of Verifier Authorization request.
. Constructs the vp\_token without proof section and sends it back to the consumer application for generating Json Web Signature (JWS).
. Receives the generated signature along with the other details and generates vp\_token with proof section & presentation\_submission.
. Sends a POST request with generated vp\_token and presentation\_submission to the received Verifier's response\_uri endpoint.

==== APIs

Below are the APIs provided by this library:

=== 1. authenticateVerifier

* Receives a list of trusted verifiers & Verifier's encoded Authorization request from consumer app(mobile wallet).
* Decodes and parse the request, extracts the clientId and verifies it against trusted verifier's list clientId.
* Returns the Authentication response which contains validated Presentation Definition of the Authorization request.

----
 val authenticationResponse = openID4VP.authenticateVerifier(urlEncodedAuthorizationRequest: String, trustedVerifierJSON: List<Verifier>)
----

====== _Parameters_

| Name                           | Type   | Description                                                                          | Sample                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| urlEncodedAuthorizationRequest | String | URL encoded query parameter string containing the Verifier's authorization request   | `"openid4vp://authorize?response_type=vp\_token &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb.."` |
| trustedVerifiers               | List   | A list of trusted Verifier objects each containing a clientId and a responseUri list | `listOf(Verifier("https://verify.env1.net",listOf("https://verify.env1.net/responseUri"))`           |

====== _Exceptions_

. DecodingException is thrown when there is an issue while decoding the Authorization Request
. InvalidQueryParams exception is thrown if
   * query params are not present in the Request
   * there is an issue while extracting the params
   * both presentation\_definition and presentation\_definition\_uri are present in Request
   * both presentation\_definition and presentation\_definition\_uri are not present in Request
. MissingInput exception is thrown if any of required params are not present in Request
. InvalidInput exception is thrown if any of required params value is empty or null
. InvalidVerifier exception is thrown if the received request client\_id & response\_uri are not matching with any of the trusted verifiers
. JWTVerification exception is thrown if there is any error in extracting public key, kid or signature verification failure.

This method will also notify the Verifier about the error by sending it to the response\_uri endpoint over http post request. If response\_uri is invalid and validation failed then Verifier won't be able to know about it.

=== 2. constructVerifiablePresentation

* Receives a map of input\_descriptor id & list of verifiable credentials for each input\_descriptor that are selected by the end-user.
* Creates a vp\_token without proof using received input\_descriptor IDs and verifiable credentials, then returns its string representation to consumer app(mobile wallet) for signing it.
