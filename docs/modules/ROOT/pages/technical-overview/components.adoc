Inji Wallet utilizes multiple libraries to provide a seamless experience.

These library are accessible as AAR for Android app and SPM(Swift Package Manager) for iOS App. Android libraries are written in Kotlin and can be easily integrated with cross platform applications like React Native or Flutter. This helps with seamless integration with other mobile wallets.

The libraries are as follows:

.  Secure Keystore SDK
.  VCI Client SDK
.  PixelPass SDK
.  Tuvali - Sharing via BLE SDK
.  OpenID4VP - Online Sharing SDK
.  Face Match SDK
.  Telemetry SDK(coming soon)

=== _1. Tuvali - Sharing via BLE SDK_

* This library facilitates the transfer of downloaded Verifiable Credential from the Wallet to Verifier.
* Tuvali enables offline VC transfer between mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The below table represents the supported roles for Android and iOS devices.

<table><thead><tr><th width="134">Wallet</th><th width="131">Verifier</th><th>VC transfer support</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Android</td><td>Android</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>iOS</td><td>Android</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>iOS</td><td>iOS</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table>

* Tuvali is actively developed and maintained by MOSIP.
  * [Kotlin Implementation](https://github.com/mosip/tuvali)
  * [Swift Implementation](https://github.com/mosip/tuvali-ios-swift)
* It does not support iOS for initiating the BLE exchanges, hence preventing two iOS devices from transferring VC.

=== _2. Face Match SDK_

The face matcher SDK internally implements native functionalities for Android and iOS, utilizing [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) to identify faces.

This SDK internally employs a `tflite` model, which is now bundled within the app. The face matcher functionality is also available via the [iriscan/biometric-sdk-react-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iriscan/biometric-sdk-react-native) NPM module, which is already integrated for offline face authentication in Inji Wallet.

<!--
Old content 
This SDK internally employs a `tflite` model, which must be created by the integrating party. The model, trained using resident faces, is stored on the MOSIP file server. Inji Wallet currently utilizes the face matcher SDK (soon to be replaced by the NPM module) for offline face authentication.

-->
The SDK is employed in two scenarios:
_During Both Offline and Online VC Sharing_: Residents can perform selfie authentication before sharing the VC with the relying party. The app opens the camera, allowing residents to take a selfie, which is then validated against the VC image to verify the resident's presence. This process is supported for both offline VC sharing (e.g., via BLE) and online login (e.g., scanning a QR code from the relying party portal and logging in using Inji Wallet).
Refer [here](integration-guide/face-match.adoc) to check the API specifications for the face matcher model.

_During Online Login_: Residents can scan the QR code from the relying party portal and opt to log in using Inji Wallet for services. In this process, residents undergo selfie authentication against the VC to confirm their presence.

=== _3. Secure Keystore SDK_

The secure-keystore library is designed for creating and storing key pairs in the hardware keystore of devices. The library supports encryption, decryption, HMAC calculation, and signing with aliases created during key pair generation.

This library is available for both Android and iOS platforms:

_ _For Android*: Refer to the [secure-keystore Kotlin library](https://github.com/mosip/secure-keystore).
_ _For iOS*: Refer to the [secure-keystore-iOS Swift library](https://github.com/mosip/secure-keystore-ios-swift).

Inji Wallet integrates with the secure-keystore library to ensure secure key management. To optimize the key size during credential download requests, Inji Wallet uses RSA-2048, ECR1, ECK1, ED25519 keys.

To check all the APIs supported by this module, refer [here](../../../technical-overview/components.adoc).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note:_

* Compatible with devices that support a hardware keystore.
* To understand the library and access API documentation, refer [here](integration-guide/secure-keystore.adoc).
* Maven snapshots are available [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.mosip/secure-keystore).
{% endhint %}

=== _4. PixelPass SDK_

The PixelPass library offers a powerful solution for creating and decoding QR codes for Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It is designed to optimize the size of the data encoded within a QR code, making it easier to store and share credential information. The library achieves this by utilizing advanced compression and encoding techniques, ensuring smaller QR codes that maintain the integrity and security of the data.

PixelPass uses zlib compression with a level 9 setting, which significantly reduces the data size before encoding. It then applies base45 encoding to further compress the data into a QR code-friendly format. Additionally, the library can decode any QR code data previously encoded using its own compression and encoding algorithms, ensuring seamless interoperability.

Additionally, for a JSON data, the library employs CBOR encoding and decoding to minimize the size even further. When a JSON Mapper similar to [Claim 169](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/overview/standards-and-specifications/169-qr-code-specification) is provided, PixelPass maps the data, applies CBOR encoding/decoding, and compresses the data, achieving maximum size reduction. Developed and maintained by MOSIP, PixelPass is continually updated to provide reliable and efficient QR code generation and decoding capabilities.

=== _5. VCI-client SDK_

VCI-Client library carries out the credential request from the consumer application (mobile wallet or web) and redirects the issuance/issuer. The library creates a request with the credential format, jwtproof of the wallet, issuer metadata and the access token received for authorization and provides VC as the response back to the consumer application for storage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

* Refer to the VCI-Client repository
  * [Kotlin Implementation](https://github.com/mosip/inji-vci-client)
  * [Swift Implementation](https://github.com/mosip/inji-vci-client-ios-swift)
* To understand about the installation and the API documentation, refer [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/integration-guide/vci-client).
* Maven snapshots are available [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.mosip/inji-vci-client)
{% endhint %}

=== _6. OpenID4VP - Online Sharing SDK_

This OpenID4VP library enables consumer applications (mobile wallet) to share users Verifiable Credentials with Verifiers who request them online. It adheres to the OpenID4VP specification which outlines the standards for requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials.

==== _This library follows the below steps to share the Verifiable Presentation with the Requested Verifier:_

. Receives the Verifier's Authorization Request sent by the consumer application (mobile wallet).
. Validates the received Authorization Request to check if the required details are present or not and then returns the Authorization Request to the consumer application once all the validations are successful.
. Receives the list of Verifiable Credentials from the consumer application which are selected by the consumer application end-user based on the credentials requested as part of Verifier Authorization request.
. Constructs the vp\_token without proof section and sends it back to the consumer application for generating Json Web Signature (JWS).
. Receives the generated signature along with the other details and generates vp\_token with proof section & presentation\_submission.
. Sends a POST request with generated vp\_token and presentation\_submission to the received Verifier's response\_uri endpoint.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

* Refer to the inji-openid4vp repository
  * [Kotlin Repository](https://github.com/mosip/inji-openid4vp)
  * [Swift Repository](https://github.com/mosip/inji-openid4vp-ios-swift)
* To understand about the installation and the API documentation, refer [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/inji-mobile/technical-overview/integration-guide/openid4vp).
* Maven snapshots are available [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.mosip/inji-openid4vp)
* Currently, the `vp_token` uses the `Ed25519Signature2020` type for digital signatures.
