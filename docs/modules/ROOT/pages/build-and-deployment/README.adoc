* To check the installed gradle version.

`gradle -V`

==== Step 4:

* Install Java JDK, refer [here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

----
[!TIP]
Restart system
----

==== Step 5:

nvm use 16.19.0
----

==== Step 9:

Install adb

----
https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickadb/
----

Configure ANDROID\_HOME and JAVA\_HOME in system environment variables

=== 2. Command to build the application

==== Step 1:

* Clone Inji repository.

==== Step 2:

* Create an `android/local.properties` file with the following data:

----
sdk.dir = <location-of-the-android-sdk>
----

* Alternatively, you can open the Android folder in the android studio. It will create `local.properties` file with `sdk.dir = <location-of-the-android-sdk>`.

____
Note:
____
>
____
* Default path for MacOS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk`
____
____
* Default path for Linux: `/home/<username>/Android/Sdk`
____
____
* Default path for Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk`
____

==== Step 3:

_ Inji application currently supports two themes: _gradient_ and _purple*.
* The default theme of the app is gradient.
* To change the theme of the application, go to `.env` file and change the value of `APPLICATION_THEME` to `purple` or `orange` to apply gradient theme

==== Step 4:

* Update mimoto url as https://api.collab.mosip.net [here](https://github.com/mosip/inji/blob/main/.env#L5)
* Update esignet host as https://esignet.collab.mosip.net [here](https://github.com/mosip/inji/blob/main/.env#L7)
* To deploy mimoto in local refer [here](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-mobile-wallet/build-and-deployment/local-setup#how-to-run-this-setup)

==== Step 5:

* Go to the root folder of the project in the terminal.
* Install all the dependencies using `npm install`.

==== Step 6:

_Build and run the application on the device:_

* Run `npm run android:mosip` to build and install the application on the device.
* Run `npm run android:mosip --reset-cache` to build and install the application if any change is made in the .env file.

=== 3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter the below issue on Windows,

----
**FAILURE:** Build failed with an exception.

**Where:**
  Script 'C:\....\inji\node_modules\expo\scripts\autolinking.gradle' line: 2

**What went wrong:**
  A problem occurred evaluating script.
  > Could not read script 'C:\"PATH"\inji\node_modules\expo\scripts\android\autolinking_implementation.gradle' as it does not exist.
----

* Run `npm i expo-modules-autolinking@~1.1.0` and rebuild the app
* Path for debug apk in Inji directory `android/app/build/outputs/apk/mosip/debug`

=== 4. Setting Up Google API Services and Client ID for Data backup & Restore

==== Step 1:

_Creating A Google Cloud Project_ Refer to this documentation on setting up a Google Cloud Project - https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project

==== Step 2:

_Enabling Google Drive APIs_ Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

![GCP API Library](../../../.gitbook/assets/gcp-api-libs.png)

Search for `Google drive API` and Select Google Drive API from the list.

Then enable the API.

![GCP Drive API Enable](../../../.gitbook/assets/drive-api.png)

==== Step 3:

_Create Google Consent Screen_

Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

Create a new Consent Screen with necessary details such as - App Name, User Support Email, App Logo and Developer Info. Once added these details Save and Continue.

==== Step 4:

_Create Oauth Client ID_

Go to - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

![GCP Create Client ID](../../../.gitbook/assets/create-CID.png)

Click on `CREATE CREDENTIALS` and choose `OAuth client ID`

![GCP Create Client ID](../../../.gitbook/assets/application-type.png)

Choose Appliation type as `Android`

![GCP Create Client ID](../../../.gitbook/assets/cid-details.png)

Add in details such as _Name_, _Package Name_ and _SHA- Fingerptint_

____
Note:
____
>
____
* SHA-1 should be of the keystore generated for signing the APK
____
____
* Make sure you have checked `Custom URI Scheme` in `Advanced Settings`
____
____
* The APK signing keystore needs to be unchanged for backup feature to work as the SHA-1 is 1-1 mapped for a client ID created
____

==== Step 5:

_Set Environment Variable_

Once the Client ID has been created copy the client ID and add it as part of `.env` file.

`GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID="<copied-client-id>"`

=== 5. Build for PlayConsole

The Internal testing version of the build can be uploaded to `PlayConsole` for testing. PlayConsole allows the creation of internal testers group.

![Internal testers](../../../.gitbook/assets/internal_testers_android.png)

_Publishing build manually to PlayConsole_

A Google play console developer account is a must to publish builds in PlayConsole.

. Set the backend URL and choose a theme (orange | purple) inside the `.env` file.
. Build the Apk or App bundle.
. Login to PlayConsole and create a new release inside Internal testers.
. Upload the Apk or App bundle to PlayConsole.

_Upload in PlayConsole_

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/upload_android.png)

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/uploading_android.png)

. Once the build is uploaded and saved you will be able to see the status of the release with version name, code, API level and some more details.

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/uploaded_view_android.png)

. Select the testers group you want to share with. Once saved, you can copy the link and share the same with the testers to test the APK or App bundle.

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/internal_testers_select_android.png)

. You are required to manually share the link with the testers as they will not receive any notifications when a new build is uploaded.

_Publishing build via Github actions (Automation) to PlayConsole_

. A Google PlayConsole developer account must be configured to Inji to publish builds via PlayConsole.

____
Testers must be added to internal testers group in Play console.
____

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/internal_testers_select_android.png)

. To deploy the Android build to PlayConsole, select `Android Custom Build` workflow from github actions.

![img.png](../../../.gitbook/assets/inji_android_github_actions.png)

. Choose the branch, backend url, theme and describe about build details.
. Click the `Run` workflow button.
. Once the pipeline has done with building the app (takes around \~25-30min), you need to login to PlayConsole and verify the build version name and code in the internal testers track.
. Now, you can share the link to testers.

*Note*: Only those who are registered in the selected testers group will be able to download the App from Google Play.
