= Version 0.17.0

_Release Name:_ Inji Mobile Wallet 0.17.0  

_Release Type:_ Developer  

_Release Date:_ 25th July, 2025 

=== Overview

This release of Inji Mobile Wallet v0.17.0 introduces multiple improvements, feature completions, and critical bug fixes across iOS and Android platforms. The release focuses on enhancing OpenID4VP cross-device flow and new feature addition for OpenIDVP same-device flow, credential verification, offline sharing stability, UI accessibility, and backwards compatibility.

=== Key Highlights

These highlight the most important new features and user-facing improvements introduced in this release:

* Cross-device OpenID4VP support (mDL / mDoc)
* Same-device OpenID4VP support (mDL / mDoc) and W3C JSON-LD VC
* Improved error handling in VC sharing and verification flows
* Crash and UI fixes in credential download and sharing features
* iOS and Kotlin implementations now aligned with OpenIDVP Draft 21 and Draft 23 support
* Secure and user-consent-backed VC sharing with improved selfie validation
* _VC Verifier SDK (ECC K1 – Kotlin):_ Kotlin artefact introduced for VC verification using ECC K1 keys, improving compatibility with OpenID ecosystems.
* _[Enhancement - PixelPass] Kotlin Multi-Platform (KMP) Support:_ Enables QR code generation using PixelPass across Android and iOS with a shared Kotlin module.
* _WLA Login via Deep Link on iOS:_ Allows users on the same mobile device to tap on a QR code and launch Inji Wallet directly, supporting seamless same-device login via deep linking.
* _Display Profile Image Only if Face is Present:_ Enhances user experience by showing the profile image only when the VC includes a valid biometric (face/photo), avoiding empty or placeholder images.

=== Technical Improvements

These represent backend, SDK, library-level, and protocol support enhancements to improve system performance, compatibility, and interoperability.

* _Wallet Metadata Support [Kotlin]:_ Wallet now responds with metadata during request_uri POST call, including supported algorithms, endpoints, and response types, improving OpenID4VP interoperability.
* _Enhancement for OpenIDVP Proof Verification_  
  Addressed issues in vp_token creation, including:
  * Empty holder field
  * Improper UUID usage in ID
  * Addition of canonicalization
* _Support for direct_post.jwt (Kotlin & Swift):_ Both Android and iOS wallets now support JWT-based direct post in line with the OpenID VP spec.
* _Enhance VCI Client Library for W3C VC Data Model 1.1:_ Added support for broader claims structure in line with VC Data Model 1.1, enabling more diverse credential types.
* _Increased Test Coverage for PixelPass Module (>80%):_ Improves quality and stability of the QR generation logic, with extensive test coverage across supported scenarios.
