_Inji Mobile_ is an open-source mobile wallet built to securely _receive, store, manage, and share Verifiable Credentials (VCs)_, whether online or offline. Designed in line with global standards such as _W3C VC Data Model_, _OpenID4VCI_, _OpenID4VP_, _ISO 18013-5 (mDL)_, and _IETF SD-JWT_, Inji Mobile enables individuals to carry digital identity, documents, certificates e.t.c with full privacy, consent, and control.

Whether you're a citizen accessing government services, a developer building digital identity applications, or a verifier validating credentials, Inji Mobile offers a trusted, standards-compliant foundation for secure and privacy-preserving interactions. As a _reference implementation_, Inji Mobile is both a ready-to-use wallet and a modular solution; its SDKs, libraries, and components can be used independently or bundled into custom apps, depending on the adopter’s needs and specific use cases.

=== Core Design Principles

_ _Interoperability-First*\
  Complies with major standards: OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, W3C Data Model, IETF SD-JWT, JWT VC, and ISO mDL/mDoc.
_ _Offline Functionality*\
  BLE-based VC sharing and _offline face authentication_, ensuring usability even in no-connectivity environments.
_ _User Sovereignty*\
  Credentials are held entirely by the user, with _granular consent-driven sharing_.
_ _Modular Security Architecture*\
  Combines robust cryptography with flexible authentication mechanisms and strong privacy guarantees.
_ _Cross-Platform Native Implementation*\
  Built in _React Native_ with Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS) integrations for native performance.

=== Capabilities Snapshot

==== Secure Storage of VCs

* Digitally signed credentials from trusted issuers
* Encrypted and integrity-verified local storage

==== Seamless Credential Sharing

_ _Offline sharing* via [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://tlodderstedt.github.io/openid-for-verifiable-presentations-offline-1_0-00.html)
_ _Online presentation* using QR-code SSO and [OpenID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)
_ Supports _same-device and cross-device* interactions

==== Authentication & Face Verification

_ Offline _face match verification* to authenticate the user during VC sharing
* Device-level biometric/passcode unlock for app access

==== Deep Link-Based SSO (Wallet Login Authentication - WLA)

* Tap-to-login via QR code scanning
* Smart redirection to service post-verification
* Works across any OpenID4VP-compliant verifier

==== Credential Download via Pre-Auth Code

_ Download credentials via _pre-authorized flow*
* Supports various credential types: national IDs, driver's licenses, health cards, academic degrees, etc.

=== How It Works

. _Credential Download_\
   Users can obtain VCs using their unique identifiers (UIN/VID or other methods), authenticate via OTP, and securely store them.
. _Credential Storage_\
   All credentials are stored encrypted, verified using the issuer’s digital signature, and integrity is validated via unique _HASH_.
. _Sharing Credentials_\
   Users can share credentials:
   * Offline using BLE
   * Online by scanning QR codes via OpenID4VP
   * Simple Upload and Scan of QR codes
. _Face Verification_\
   Optional offline face authentication ensures the right holder is presenting credentials during in-person verifications.
. _Consent & Privacy_\
   Credential sharing is _consent-based_, giving users full control over what data is shared and with whom.

=== Sneak Peek: Upcoming Features

_ Support for _W3C Data Model 2.0_ and _SVG Templates*
_ _Selective Disclosure_ using _SD-JWT*
_ Support for _JWT-format credentials*
_ _Presentation During Issuance*
_ _Wallet Login with IdPs* (OpenID4VP-based WLA)
_ _Credential Revocation Support*

=== Summary

_Inji Mobile_ is more than just a credential wallet, it’s a _reference implementation_ for inclusive, offline-capable, standards-compliant digital identity. With full support for online and offline VC flows, strong cryptographic safeguards, and a user-first design, it provides a powerful tool for citizens, developers, and governments alike. Inji Mobile gives you the _interoperable building blocks_ you need.

Overview
Inji provides a way to share tamper-proof, instantly verifiable data which is cryptographically signed by a trusted issuer, and users can store them securely on their devices or browsers and share them when needed.



What is Verifiable Credentials and how does it help?

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a way to share tamper-proof, instantly verifiable data. They are cryptographically signed by a trusted issuer, and users can store them securely on their devices or browsers and share them when needed.

Examples of Verifiable Credentials include:

* A national ID issued as a digital credential
* A diploma issued by a university
* A background verification report from an employer
* A subsidy or benefit eligibility certificate from a government agency

VCs allow:
* Instant verification, even offline
* User control over when and how data is shared
* Interoperability across platforms and borders
* Reduced fraud and manual checks

These credentials are held in a secure digital wallet—either on mobile or through a web browser—and can be reused across services, eliminating repetitive processes and improving both user experience and system integrity.



What Is Inji?

Inji is a comprehensive stack that enables the secure issuance, storage, exchange, and verification of Verifiable Credentials. It replaces traditional, paper-based processes with a trusted digital-first approach, empowering individuals and simplifying service delivery across sectors.

Inji's "Triangle of Trust" in VCs:
The VC model operates on a "triangle of trust" involving three main roles:

* Issuer: The entity that issues the credential and makes claims about the subject (e.g., a university issuing a degree, a government issuing a passport, an employer issuing a work permit). The issuer cryptographically signs the VC. 
* Holder: The individual or entity who possesses the credential (e.g., the student with the degree, the citizen with the passport, the employee with the work permit). The holder stores and manages their VCs.

* Verifier: The entity that requests and verifies the credential to confirm a claim (e.g., an employer checking a degree, a border agent checking a passport, a landlord checking a work permit). The verifier checks the cryptographic proofs to ensure the VC's authenticity and integrity.


How it work (simplified):
* Issuance: An issuer creates a digital credential with claims about a subject and cryptographically signs it.
* Holding: The signed credential is then given to the holder, who stores it securely in a digital wallet or similar application.
* Presentation: When needed, the holder can present the VC (or a verifiable presentation, which can include multiple VCs or selectively disclosed information) to a verifier.
* Verification: The verifier uses the cryptographic proofs within the VC to confirm that it was issued by a trusted party and has not been tampered with. This verification often involves checking against a "Verifiable Data Registry" where public keys of issuers are stored.
