= Features

Inji Mobile is an open-source digital wallet designed to enable individuals to receive, store, and present Verifiable Credentials (VCs) securely, both online and offline. Purpose-built to align with global standards like W3C VC, OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, SD-JWT, and ISO 18013-5 (mDL), it brings interoperability, user autonomy, and strong cryptographic guarantees to digital identity ecosystems.

=== Download, Verify, and Store Verifiable Credentials

Inji Wallet makes it easy and secure for residents to manage their digital identity and credentials. From downloading and verifying to sharing and backing up Verifiable Credentials (VCs), this guide outlines all key features and workflows available in the wallet.

=== Downloading Verifiable Credentials

==== OpenID for VC Issuance

Residents can download VCs from trusted issuers integrated with OpenID for the VCI protocol.

_Example Issuers:_

* Republic of Veridonia National ID Department - National ID
* StayProtected Insurance - Insurance Credentials
* Republic of Veridonia Tax Department - Tax ID
* AgroVeritas Property & Land Registry - Land Record
* Veridonia Department of Motor Vehicles - mDoc

==== Pre-Authorised Credential Offers (Without Transaction Code)

* Users download credentials directly using a credential\_offer URI
* No login required; pre-auth code embedded in the offer
* Used in mass issuance or public campaigns (e.g., vaccination certificates, offline cards)

==== Pre-Authorised Credential Offers (With Transaction Code)

* Adds a one-time transaction code (OTP / claim code) to bind issuance to the user
* User enters code in-app to retrieve VC securely
* Ideal for privacy-sensitive issuance (e.g., mDL, insurance)

=== Verifying Credential Authenticity

Inji Mobile Wallet uses robust cryptographic libraries to verify that the VC is:

* Digitally signed by a trusted issuer.
* Cryptographically valid based on proof type.
